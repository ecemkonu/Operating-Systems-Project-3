# Operating Systems Project 3 #

Problem definition: In a painting shop, boxes are being painted. Assume that each box is
painted only in one color and that all boxes are of the same size. Changing colors in the painting process is expensive due to the added cost of wasted paint and solvents involved with
each color change in addition to the extra time required for the changing process. Therefore,
the objective is to order the boxes in a way to minimize the number of paint changeovers.

Painting shop pipeline is implemented.
